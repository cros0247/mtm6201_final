1. ## Tell us about your process,

My though process what simple, the goal was to make a software that someone who works in Management, at the hospital, would use. So, my understanding would be that someone who works on management, doesnâ€™t care about things specifically like the status of individual patients or equipment. Someone who works in management would obviously be more focus on managing, reviewing, and recording the hospital as well as be more focus on administrative stuff like security and finances. Hence there is not a lot of colors, pictures, or needless clutter to make the software "look pretty", I kept it simple, straight to the point with information (both visual and numerical) and easy to differentiate sections.


2. ## What challenges did you face during development and how did you overcome those changes. 

Im not super fluent in java or informational creating graphs, so it was a creative workout to make the pie chart myself, thankfully I was able to outsource the bar graphs from a public CSS Framework (**chartscss.org**). 


3. ## What have you learned while working on this project?" 

Ive learned that outsourcing to public libraries is arguably the most useful tool when creating any website as a whole, as well as using the CSS attribute *flex* and all its sibling attributes is my most preferred way to organize my layouts.



4. ## Finally, include a list of any assets or resources you used that was not your own, including any frameworks, libraries, plugins, fonts, or images. You will need to use the markdown language to format your README.md file.
